			<p>Check it. These are minor chords.</p>
			<p>Theyre like the major chords but the middle note has been taken down by a half-step (e.g: the C chord (C E G) becomes Cm (C D&#9837 G))
			<h3>The Am Chord</h3>
			<p> This the A minor chord. We write it as Am. You can hover over it to see how it compares to a regular A chord.</p>
			<div class = "swapPic amChord"></div>
			<h3>The Cm Chord</h3>
			<div class = "swapPic cmChord"></div>
			<h3>The Dm Chord</h3>
			<div class = "swapPic dmChord"></div>
			<h3>The Em Chord</h3>
			<div class = "swapPic emChord"></div>
			<h3>The Gm Chord</h3>
			<div class = "swapPic gmChord"></div>
			
			<h3>So how are minor chords formed</h3>
			<p> I was going to write a whole load of guff here about how chords are formed actually explaining the ways and all of that, but i decided I can't be bothered because i have run out of time.</p>
