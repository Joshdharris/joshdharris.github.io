			<h2>Understanding how music is structured</h2>
			
			<p>There are literally only 12 musical notes in existance, and every song ever written contains various combinations of these musical notes. These notes consist of A, A#, B, C, C#, D D#, E, F, F#, G, G#  (There are no B# or E#). Looking at a piano, we see the notes like this: </p>
			<img src = "Images/mt1/piano_key.png" alt = "You really need to see the picture..." class= "internalPics">

			<p>	The black keys are all the "sharps" and the white keys are all the 'natural notes'</p>

			<div class = "sideNotes">
				<h5>Important Side Note:</h5>
				<p>A flat(&#9837) is another way of writing the sharp (&#9839) of the previous note. So an A# is the same as a Bb.
			</div>

			<p>Let's look at all the different notes on a guitar. You'll see it's the sane thing. The guitar can only play those 12 notes.</p>
			<img src = "Images/mt1/guitar-notes.png" alt = "A guitar fretboard with the keys labelled">

			
			<p>Melodically, certain notes sound good to our ears when we play them together. Others sound wrong. That's why when a kid goes ham on a keyboard, we don't like the sound - because the notes are not harmoniously working together</p>

			<h2>Building a scale</h2>
			<p>So it helps if we know a little about how to play music that works together. Basically in a musical and biological sense we need certain groups of keys to be played together as this sounds right. When you first start, you're going to want to stay within these restricitions, but as your playing progresses you can start to blend them together. 
			These combinations of notes that work well toegether are called a scale. </p>

			<p> Now to build a scale, we need to know what notes or keys to have in our scale. When talking musically, we can talk about moving in steps. A whole step is moving up 2 notes, and a half-step is moving up 1 note. (I know it's dumb, but that's how it works). Have a look at the diagram below: </p>
			<p>H,A THERE'S NO DIAGRAM, BECAUSE I DIDN'T ADD ONE!</P> 

			<P>Get it? So going from A to A# is a half step. Adding another half-step we can go from A# to B, so A to B is 1 whole step. Easy-peasy!</P>
			
			<p>	There are many different scales and each scale has a different formula so you can know what notes are in that scale. We will look first at the MAJOR SCALE:</p>

			<h3>The C Major Scale</h3>
			<p>	The C major scale consists of all the white keys on the keyboard. Nice and easy - there's no sharps or flats to worry about. So what are the notes in the major scale? </p>
			<p><b>A, B, C, D, E, F, G.</b></p>
			<img src = "Images/mt1/piano_cMajScale.png" alt = "Just the natural notes">

			<p>And that's it! That's the major scale. Whoop-de-freaking-do, right? Who gives a monkey's? Well, once you can understand how the major scale works, you can begin to understand how almost any scale works. The trick is just to learn the formula to get the correct notes, and you're golden. It doesn't matter what note we start with, if we follow the formula, we can get the scale for that key. </p>
			
			<div class = "sideNotes">
				<h5>Be aware</h5>
				<p>The other thing to note is that each key can start a scale, and the notes for that scale will be different but the formula will remain the same.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>The Major Scale 'Formula'</h2>
			<p> Are you intrigued? What's this magicial formula that will open up a world of musical wonder?</p>
			<p>	The formula for the major scale is <b>WHOLE, WHOLE, HALF, WHOLE, WHOLE, WHOLE, HALF.</b></p>
			<p>Wait, what does any of that actually mean?! Remember, if we go up a half step we move up 1 note. If we go up a whole step, we move up 2 notes</p>
			<p>	Look at the piano again. We start at C, we go 1 whole step - D, whole step - E, half step - F, whole step - G, whole step - A, whole step - B, half step - C. </p>
			
			<p> Once we get back to C we have all the notes that are in our scale. We can repeat the formula as we go down the keyboard and you'll see only the same notes showing up.</p>
			
			<p>
			So C is easy enough. What about any of the other keys. What about if we started with D? We simply apply the same formula.
			Start from D, whole step E, whole step F#, half step G, whole step A, whole step B, whole step C#, half step D. So the D major scale is D, E, F#, G, A, B, C#
			</p>
			
			<p>

			And we can do this for any key. Give it a try yourself for some of the other starting keys. 
			</p>
			
			<p>

			This is great and everything, but how does this help play an instrument? Well, as an absolute beginner, if you start playing with your first note in the key and then only play the other keys in the scale, even if it's a totally random order, it will still sound much better if you only play the notes in that scanle than if you just randomly play any notes.

			The other cool thing is it helps us to understand chords.
