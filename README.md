This is a fake website I designed as part of a web design project.

The content of the website was not as important as the ability to showcase an understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Hence, the actual depth of content for the website varies. The webpages are designed dynamically, to change in size according to resolution/screen size, and typically look nicer on a smaller screen.

The final page includes a user form with error checking. Note, that no information is actually gathered as I didn't want to risk someone stumbling on the website and actually inputting genuinely card details (no reason why they should, but still...). The form simply checks that the credit card number is 16 digits long and the pin is 4 digits long. It is designed humourously. Note, that I was learning about cookies, and hence any information input in that form may be stored in the form of a cookie on the user's computer.
